  title: More More More Components!
  mainText: 'Now that we have a feel for what components are, we need to know how
    to add them. Adding components to a gameobject allows you to further customize
    what that gameobject does. For example, if we want our object to respond and
    work with the Physics engine, we can add a rigidbody to customize how this objects
    will respond to physics interactions. To add a component, we have to:


    1.
    Select the target gameobject

    2. In the inspector, go to the bottom and click
    add component.

    3. Search for the component you need with the text box.

    4.
    Double click on the component to add the component.


    Let''s try those steps
    on your Cube and add a Rigidbody component to the Cube.'
