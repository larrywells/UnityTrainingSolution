  mainText: "Now you can see colored waves have populated in the profiler. These
    waves in the CPU Usage category represent the current FPS and response time of
    the application. By clicking on any part of the waves, you can view the program
    at a specific point. Try clicking on one of the spikes of the waves where the
    FPS dropped.\n\nA white bar will appear where you cliked and mark the location
    we are looking at now. Now lets look at the overview window at the bottom of
    the profiler. We can see there is a \"PlayerLoop\". These are all the actions
    being executed in our application in the Play Mode (when we press the play button).
    Now click the right-facing arrow to extend this list.\n\nHere we can see a list
    of events that are marked by Unity to be profiled or scanned. We can see how
    much time each action took to execute and how much of our CPU Usage is coming
    from which action. \n\nHowever, if we want to see profiling data from ALL of
    our scripts. We need to do one more step called Deep Profiling."
