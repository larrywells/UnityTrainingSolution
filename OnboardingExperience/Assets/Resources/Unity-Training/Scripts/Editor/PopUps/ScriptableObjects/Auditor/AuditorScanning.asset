    is a button that says Analyze. Pressing this button will also reload all of your
    scripts so don't be alarmed. It will go through each of your scripts and even
    build settings for the project and detect possible errors or optimizations that
    can be made. \n\nGo ahead and press analyze and we will take a look at the report."
