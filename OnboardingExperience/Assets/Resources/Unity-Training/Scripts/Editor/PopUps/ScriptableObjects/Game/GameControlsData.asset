    themselves. These are the play, pause and step buttons:


    Play - This button
    switches to game view and starts playing the build as if a user was using it.


    Pause
    - This button stops all live interactions on the applications and freezes the
    runtime loops.


    Step - This button allows you to move forward 1 frame at
    a time for precise movements to investigate how the game is running.'
