  mainText: "GPU profiling is very similar to CPU profiling with one caveat, profiling
    the GPU has performance overhead costs so it is disabled by default. If you are
    currently collecting other performance data you don't want to have GPU profiling
    enabled at the same time. Only collect GPU data when you are only looking at
    GPU data. \n\nTo enable the GPU Usage module, we go to the \"profiler modules\"
    tab and click the down arrow to the right. We then want to checkmark the \"GPU
    Usage\" module. Once GPU usage is enabled we can record data just like we did
    in the previous methods. Go ahead and collect another profiling sample recording.\n\n1.
    Enable the GPU Usage module\n2. Enable deep profile.\n2. Click the white circle
    recording button to begin recording.\n3. Click the play button above game view
    to start a recording.\n\nNow that you have a recording sample with GPU usage
    on, click anywhere on the data so we can see the data like we did with CPU usage.
    Let's look to the overview window for more details. In the GPU Usage window we
    have some different metrics to track and record for performance. In this module
    we get to know how much each script used of our GPU, how many times the GPU is
    called on to make a draw, and the time it took the GPU to execute each draw.
    When we run into a GPU bottle neck we want to collect all of this data for our
    highest usage scripts under the Player Loop."
