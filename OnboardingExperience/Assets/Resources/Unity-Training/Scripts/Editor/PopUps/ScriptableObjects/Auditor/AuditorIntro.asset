  title: I Need An Audit!
  mainText: Project Auditor is a static analysis tool that analyzes assets, settings,
    and scripts of the Unity project and produces a report containing information
    useful to the development team on the project for optimizing the project and
    fixing potential bugs or isues before they occur. QA mainly uses this as a reporting
    tool to give to the development team as an assessment of possible project health.
    Open the Auditor Tool by going to Window > Analysis > Auditor.
