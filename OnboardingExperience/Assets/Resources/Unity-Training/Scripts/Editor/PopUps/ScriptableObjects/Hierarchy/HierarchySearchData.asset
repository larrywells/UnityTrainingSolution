  title: Searching For Objects
  mainText: 'One last cool tip about the hiearchy. You can click the hierarchy and
    press "Ctrl+f" or click the search bar above this box to find specific gameobjects
    by name in the hierarchy. This is useful when you go on bigger projects that
    may have hundreds of gameobjects in the scene at a time!


    When you search
    for a gameobject, the editor will mask out the gameobjects that don''t match
    your search both in the hierarchy and in the scene window so you can easily find
    your object. Try searching for the cube you just made and check the hierarchy
    and scene window as you type!


    When you are done, back out your search text
    and press "Continue".'
