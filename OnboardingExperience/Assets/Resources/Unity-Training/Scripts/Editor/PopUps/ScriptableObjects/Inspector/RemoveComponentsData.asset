  title: Get Rid Of This Component!
  mainText: 'Let''s say you have a component on a gameobject causing issues for you.
    There are two ways to go about getting the component out of your way. Disabling
    or Removing.


    First, disabling a component keeps the component on the gameobject
    but makes it inactive so that the component is not actively running. This makes
    it act like the component is deleted but it can be toggled back on when needed.
    To disable a component, you click the checkmark toggle box OFF that is to the
    left of the components name in the inspector.


    Second, to permanently disable
    a component we can just delete it. To delete a component there are two ways.
    One way, you can right click on the component name and select "Remove Component".
    The other way is to click the 3 dots on the right side of the components window
    across from it''s name and select "Remove Component".


    Let''s try removing
    that Rigidbody component you added to your cube!'
