  mainText: 'Adding a package in the package manager is very easy. If the package
    you are looking for is in the Unity Registy you click the "Packages: " tab in
    the top left of the window, click the Unity Registry option in the drop down,
    select your package from the list and click install in the bottom right corner
    of the window. The Unity Registry are official unity packages that can be installed
    but do not come by default with every project as that would make projects too
    big.


    If you need to install a package that is not in the Unity Registry,
    we use GIT URLs. To do this, click the white plus button in the top left corner
    and select "add package from GIT url". Next we are going to install the Project
    Auditor since we need that later in the tutorial. Paste this link in the text
    box and click the "add" button: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ProjectAuditor.git'
