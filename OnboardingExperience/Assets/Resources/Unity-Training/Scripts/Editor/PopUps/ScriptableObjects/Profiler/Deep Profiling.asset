  mainText: 'To enabled deep profiling we must first click on the "deep profile"
    tab on the top of the Profiler. Once this is enabled your scripts may refresh
    so don''t be alarmed. You know this option is enabled because it will be highlighted
    with a light gray. After deep profile is enabled, you can press record and play
    to get another scan.


    So what is Deep Profiling? Deep Profiling checks every
    script that is executing on the application at runtime instead of just the scripts
    that are specifically marked for profiling. This allows you to get more accurate
    data from the profiler about where your CPU usage is going.


    Note: Deep
    Profiling does add small overhead to builds with this enabled.'
