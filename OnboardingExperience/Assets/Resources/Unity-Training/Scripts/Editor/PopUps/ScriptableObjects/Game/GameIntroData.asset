    application on their system. We can use game view to test out the game in the
    editor. Note, playing a game in the editor does not always give the same results
    as playing live so you always want to test the final build not in the editor.
    Pressing the play button will also switch the view from scene view to game view.
    \n\nSwitch between the scene and game view to see the differences."
