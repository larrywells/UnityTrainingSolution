  title: Trouble At The Foutain
  details: Hello there! I'm trying to get water out of the local foutain but something's
    wrong! Everytime I use the foutain, the world around me starts to freeze and
    act up! Could you please check it out for me? The foutain is to the left, you
    can walk up to it and press E to activate the foutain. Maybe you could use some
    sort of profiler tool to diagnose the issue?
