  title: Checking Components
  mainText: "Game objects are essentially empty buckets that hold components. All
    of the objects in your hierarchy are just constructed of multiple differen't
    components that allow them to perform there functionality. Using the inspector
    we can see what components are on an object and even edit some of the fields.
    Lets go through our cube's components as an example so you can get a feel for
    hour gameobjects are built up from components.\n\nWe can see here our cube has
    a few components: \n- The Transform components stores information about the size,
    location and rotation of the cube.\n- To determine how are cube is constructed,
    we use a Mesh Filter which in simple terms just stores a mesh that determines
    how the shape of the object will be constructed, this is what gives us that cube
    shape. \n- The Mesh Renderer component is responsible for drawing the mesh on
    the screen. \n- The Box Collider allows the object to be registered for physics
    collisions with other objects.\n- The Material components controls the color
    of the cube.\n\nGiven the above, we can see an example of how a gameobject is
    really just a series of different components and it's actually the components
    that determine what a gameobject is and what a gameobject does."
