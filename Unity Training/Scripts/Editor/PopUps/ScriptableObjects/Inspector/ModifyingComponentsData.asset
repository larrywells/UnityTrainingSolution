  title: Let's Get Custom!
  mainText: "Like I mentioned earlier, we can even edit the fields inside components
    for even more custom behavior. A common modification we may need to do is altering
    the location of a gameobject. Later we will learn how to do this in the Scene
    View but for now, let's practice with modifying components. Lets change how high
    our object is. Under the Transform component, we can change the value of Position
    Y to any other value and the object will move to that value on the Y-Axis. \n\nWe
    can even do math in these boxes! Let's say you had a height of 1.735 and wanted
    exactly double that height, you can just type 1.735 * 2 in the Y value box, press
    enter and it will do the calculation for you.\n\nLet's try modifying the Y position
    value of the Transform component in our Cube."
