  mainText: Now that we can create and modify gameobjects, where do they go? When
    we create or add a gameobject to the hierchy it gets created in what is a called
    a "Scene Window". This is also commonly referred to as "Scene View". In the next
    section we are going to learn how to navigate around the scene view to interact
    with the objects we have been creating.
