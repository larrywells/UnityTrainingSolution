  mainText: "Sometimes you may want to change how your camera works in the scene
    view so you can navigate around your level easier. To access the scene camera
    settings you can click the camera icon to the left of \"Gizmos\" above this window.
    The first group of settings controls how things are rendered by the scene camera.
    The second group of settings controls how the camera moves around in the scene.
    These settings have no effect on the in-game camera game objects and only impact
    the scene cameras.\n\n- Field of View: This setting changes the height of the
    camera's view angle.\n- Dynamic Clipping: \n- Occlusion Culling: This setting
    when enabled will not render objects outside of the camera's view angle. This
    can save performance in Editor mode when you have a very large scene.\n\n- Camera
    Easing: Easing creates smooth motion when the camera starts moving and stops
    moving. This motion allows the camera to smoothly come up to max speed and slow
    down to a halt.\n- Camera Acceleration: When acceleration is applied, the camera
    is allowed to gain speed during movement allowing for quick navigation across
    large areas.\n- Camera Speed: This is the current speed of the scene camera."
