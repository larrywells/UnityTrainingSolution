  title: Look Upon Thy Scene
  mainText: The scene view is where we can see how gameobjects are placed into our
    game or application. The scene view represents a 3D space that the user will
    be navigating around. We can see each time we create or add an object in the
    hierarchy, that object is created in our scene. Look! There is our cube in the
    scene window to the right. The sun symbol is the directional light and the camera
    symbol is the main camera. We can't see the first gameobject we created because
    it is an empty gameobject. This means it only has a transform components so it
    doesn't have any components that allows it to render for us. Like we discussed
    earlier in this tutorial, game objects have to be built up from components or
    they will just be empty invisible buckets.
