  title: Pick an object
  mainText: Just like with the hierarchy we can use the scene view to select objects
    too! To select an object on the scene view, you can left click directly on the
    object you want to select. Additionally, if you press the 'F' key while you are
    selecting an object, it will zoom in on that object so you can see it better.
    To remember this hotkey, you can think of the F standing for "Find" when in the
    scene view.
