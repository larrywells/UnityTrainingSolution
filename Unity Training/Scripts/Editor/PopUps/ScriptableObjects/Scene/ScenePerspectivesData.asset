    compass. This is the sphere and cone shaped tool in the upper right hand corner
    of the scene view. Click on the different shapes and faces of the compass allows
    you to see your scene from specific views. This can be useful to test that your
    scene looks correct from all viewable angles.


    Take a second to play around
    with the different views then continue when ready.'
