  title: Creating Parented Objects
  mainText: "In the Hierarchy, you can also drag objects on top of other objects
    to make nested or parented objects. Much like how you would drag a file into
    a folder on your desktop. You can use this to organize the Hierarchy in the same
    way as a folder by dragging objects onto a parent and then clicking the down
    arrow to minimize the list of objects. Certain transformations done to a parent
    object like scale and movement will often be shared to it's children. We will
    learn how to manipulate objects later, for now, making the \"Main Camera\" a
    parented object by dragging all of the other objects in the Hierarchy onto the
    Main Camera. \n\nHint: When you click the down arrow next to \"Main Camera\"
    to close the list, you should ONLY see the Main Camera in the Hierarchy. You
    should have 3 objects under the Main Camera in this way. Your renamed object,
    the cube and the directional light."
